# Emotion-Driven-Speech-Transcription-and-Cross-Lingual-Translation-with-Arabic-TTS-Integration
This project develops an emotion-oriented system for recognizing emotions in English speech, transcribing it, translating it into Arabic, and synthesizing it with Arabic TTS. The focus is on preserving emotional context across languages, ensuring both linguistic and emotional content remain intact for multilingual communication.
