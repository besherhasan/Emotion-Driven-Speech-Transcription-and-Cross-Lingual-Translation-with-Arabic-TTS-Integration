# Emotion-Driven Speech Transcription and Cross-Lingual Translation with Arabic TTS Integration

This repository contains the implementation of a multilingual and emotion-driven system designed to enhance customer service interactions in the banking domain. The system integrates **Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)**, **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)**, **Machine Translation (MT)**, and **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**, enabling emotion-preserving, cross-lingual communication.

---

## Background

Effective communication across languages and emotions is critical, especially in customer service industries like banking. Language barriers and the inability to recognize customer emotions can hinder the resolution of issues. This project bridges these gaps by creating an end-to-end system that:
- Recognizes emotions in speech.
- Transcribes speech to text.
- Translates text across languages.
- Synthesizes speech—all while retaining emotional nuances.

---

## Architectures

The system employs the following models:
- **Speech Emotion Recognition (SER):**
  - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for recognizing emotions from audio signals.
  - Incorporates data augmentation and feature extraction techniques like MFCCs and ZCR for improved performance.
- **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR):**
  - **Whisper** by OpenAI, a transformer-based model for robust English transcription.
- **Machine Translation (MT):**
  - **MarianMT**, a fine-tuned, pre-trained transformer-based model for English-to-Arabic translation.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):**
  - **MMS-TTS-Ara**, a model for generating natural Arabic speech while retaining emotional tones.

## Methodology
The pipeline follows these steps:

Emotion Detection (SER): Analyzes the customer's voice to detect emotional tone using a CNN.
Speech Transcription (ASR): Converts English speech to text using Whisper.
Text Translation (MT): Translates English text to Arabic using fine-tuned MarianMT.
Speech Synthesis (TTS): Converts translated Arabic text to speech using MMS-TTS-Ara.
Contributions

## This project introduces:

A multilingual pipeline preserving emotional context in speech translation.
Fine-tuned MarianMT for domain-specific English-Arabic translations.
Integration of SER, ASR, MT, and TTS into a seamless system.
Practical applications in the banking domain to improve customer service experience.


## Contribution
Our project introduces an innovative integration of emotion-driven speech transcription and cross-lingual translation, tailored specifically for the banking customer service domain. Unlike traditional systems, we prioritize the retention of emotional context throughout the communication pipeline, ensuring empathetic and effective service delivery. By leveraging state-of-the-art models such as a CNN for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER), Whisper for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), fine-tuned MarianMT for machine translation, and MMS-TTS-Ara for Arabic Text-to-Speech (TTS), we deliver a seamless end-to-end multilingual solution. Key contributions include:

Preserving emotional nuances during translation to enhance client engagement.
Achieving high translation accuracy (BLEU score of 56 and BERTScore F1 of 88.7%) and robust emotion detection (F1-score of 94%).
Demonstrating practical applications in the banking sector, addressing language and emotional barriers to improve customer satisfaction and responsiveness.
This work bridges linguistic and emotional gaps in automated systems, presenting a transformative solution for customer service.


## Challenges
Limited Data: Domain-specific datasets for fine-tuning were limited, affecting performance.
Hardware Constraints: Training and inference required high computational power.
Integration: Combining SER, ASR, MT, and TTS demanded significant preprocessing and optimization.

## Future Directions
Dataset Expansion: Incorporate larger, diverse datasets for better performance.
